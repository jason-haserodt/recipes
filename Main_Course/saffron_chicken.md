1. Rinse and dry **herbs**, roughly chop, and set aside with the **fennel and pepper slices**.  Mince the **garlic** and set aside as well.
1. Once the **cooked chicken** is cool enough to handle, cut or tear into bite sized pieces.  Place in a large mixing bowl and add 1/2 to 2/3 of **orange paste**.  Stir well to coat the chicken.
1. Add the **prepared fennel, chile, herbs and garlic**.  Toss with 2 tbsp **olive oil** and **lemon juice**.
