- 2 medium onions, finely chopped
- 1 lbs ground lamb
- 50 g pine nuts
- 20 g parsley, chopped
- 2 tsp tomato paste
- 3 tsp sugar
- 2/3 cup water
- 1.5 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp lime juice
- 4 cinnamon sticks
- salt and pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425F.  Chop **onions** and set aside.
1. Cut **eggplant** in half, place skin side down in a roasting pan that is large enough to accomodate them snugly.  Brush the flesh with 4 tbsp **olive oil** and season with 1 tsp **salt** and plenty of **black pepper**.
1. Roast for about 20 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool slighly.
1. Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp **olive oil** in a large frying pan.  Mix together the **cumin**, **paprika**, and **ground cinnamon**.  
1. Add **half the spice mix** to the pan and add **onions**.  Cook over medium-high heat for about 8 minutes, stirring often.
1. Add the **lamb**, **pine nuts**, **parsley**, **tomato paste**, 1 tsp **sugar**, 1 tsp **salt**, and some **black pepper**.  Continue to cook and stir for another 8 minutes, until the meat is cooked.
1. Place the **remaining spice mix** in a bowl and add the **water**, **lemon juice**, **lime juice**, the remaining 2 tsp **sugar**, **cinnamon sticks**, and 1/2 tsp **salt**.  Mix well.
1. Reduce the oven temperature to 375F.  Pour the **spice mix** into the bottom of the **eggplant roasting pan**.  Spoon the **lamb mixture** on top of each **eggplant**.  Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil, return to the oven, and roast for 1.5 hours, by which point the eggplants should be completely soft and the sauce thick.
1. Twice during cooking, remove foil and baste the **eggplants** with the **sauce**, adding some water if the sauce dries out.
1. Serve warm, not hot, or at room temperature.
