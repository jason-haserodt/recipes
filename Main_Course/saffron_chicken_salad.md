_Cuisine:  Palestinian_<br />
_Course:  Main Course_

## Ingredients

- 1 orange
- 50 g honey
- 1/2 tsp saffron threads
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 1 1/4 cups water
- 2 1/4 lbs chicken breast
- 4 tbsp olive oil
- 2 fennel bulbs, thinly sliced
- 15 g (1 cup) cilantro leaves
- 15 g (2/3 cup) basil leaves, torn
- 15 leaves mint, torn
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 red chile, thinly sliced
- 1 clove garlic, crushed
- salt and black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400F.  Slice **fennel** and **chile** thinly and set aside.
1. Top and tail **orange** and slice into 12 wedges, keeping skin on.  Remove any seeds.
1. Place **orange wedges** in a small saucepan with the **honey**, **saffron**, **vinegar**, and just enough **water** to cover the oranges.  Bring to a boil and simmer gently for about an hour.
1. Using a food processor, blitz **oranges and cooking liquid** into a smooth, runny paste.  Add more **water**, if needed.
1. Meanwhile, mix **chicken breast** with 2 tbsp **olive oil** and plenty of **salt and pepper** and place on a very hot grill pan.  Sear for about 2 minutes per side to get clear char marks all over.
1. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until just cooked.
1. Once the **chicken** is cool enough to handle, but still warm, cut into rough, large pieces.  Place in a mixing bowl and stir in at least half of the **orange paste**.  Save rest of the **orange paste** for another use.
1. Add the **remaining ingredients**, including 2 tbsp **olive oil**, and toss gently.  Taste, add **salt and pepper**, and, if needed, more **olive oil** and **lemon juice**.
